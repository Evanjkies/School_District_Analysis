# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
With this project the goal was to take a dataset that contained math and reading scores from various high schools and remove a compromised section of scores from the data. After this compromised section was removed, the passing grade percentages, as well as the other figures mentioned in the dataset, were recalculated.
